I’m Dhanush Pillay, a CSE student who loves turning small ideas into real projects. I explore Python, cybersecurity, AI integration, web development and cloud while learning something new every day.

I like experimenting, breaking things, fixing them and getting a little better with every build.

Always curious. Always coding. Always growing.
